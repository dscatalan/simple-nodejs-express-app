**Assignment 2: Secure Web Programming and Node.js - Question 3**

> In this exercise you will get some hands on experience in secure webapp development practices package installation in node.js, and OWASP password security.
>
>
> Write a simple node.js express app that allows users to keep track of online notes.
> The program has the following requirements;
> 1. Listens on port 3000 of localhost
> 2. Allows the user to create an account using user name and password.
> 3. The server must check the password strength according to the OWASP strength standards. You can solve this by using the following package https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-password-strengthLinks to an external site. (documentation included).  If the password is too weak, the server can simply return a page telling the user about this and not create an account.
> 4. Once the account is created, the user is allowed to login.
> 5. When logged in the user has the following options:
> (a) View all notes
> (b) Type a new note and save
> Any reasonable design satisfying the requirements and based on the best practices discussed in class will qualify.
>
> NOTES:
> You may use text files for all storage functions.
> Your program must use all the best security programming practices
